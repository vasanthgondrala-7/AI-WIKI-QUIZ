        You are an expert educational content creator. Create a comprehensive quiz based on the following Wikipedia article content.
        
        ARTICLE CONTENT:
        {article_text[:8000]}  # Limit text length
        
        IMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS:
        1. Generate 5-8 high-quality quiz questions that test understanding of key concepts
        2. Questions should be factual and directly based on the provided content
        3. Each question must have exactly 4 options labeled A, B, C, D
        4. Provide the correct answer as JUST THE LETTER (A, B, C, or D) - NOT the full text
        5. Assign appropriate difficulty levels (easy, medium, hard)
        6. Provide a brief explanation for each answer
        7. Extract key entities (people, organizations, locations)
        8. Identify main sections of the article
        9. Suggest 3-5 related Wikipedia topics for further reading
        
        CRITICAL: The "answer" field must contain ONLY the letter (A, B, C, or D), not the full option text.
